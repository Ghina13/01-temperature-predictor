# 🌤️ Temperature Predictor

A simple machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to predict tomorrow's temperature based on recent days.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 🧪 How It Works

We provide a few days of past temperatures, train a regression model, and predict the temperature for the next day.

### 📈 Sample Output
the possible temperature for tomorrow will be:36.0
